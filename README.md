# Safety Detection in Restricted Area

This repository contains the code for detecting safety violations in restricted areas using computer vision techniques. The project aims to enhance safety by identifying individuals entering restricted zones and triggering appropriate alerts.



## Overview
The Safety Detection in Restricted Area project uses advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor and detect unauthorized entry into restricted zones. The system can be integrated with existing security infrastructure to provide real-time alerts and enhance overall safety.

## Features
- Real-time detection of safety violations
- High accuracy and efficiency
- Easy integration with existing security systems
- Customizable parameters for different environments
